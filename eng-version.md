### Grading System Reform Proposal for CUHK-Shenzhen

* _We demand responses from the university by **23:59 June 10th** regarding **viability of the proposal** and **the roadmap for change**. We believe in what C. Northcote Parkinson puts, **DELAY IS THE DEADLIEST FORM OF DENIAL**. Empty words are not regarded as valid response. We, as stakeholders, deserve transparency in the decision making process as well._
* _Up to about **700 students** have explicitly endorsed this and around **20% of all students** from year 2023, year 2024 and year 2025 expressed their approval by cosigning below within 24 hours, with **even many more** that may be reluctant to reveal their names agreeing with the proposal._
* _Takeaway: we purpose three possible solutions to GPA reform, whose details are unfolded below._

#### Key Proposal I - P/F Mechanism:

1. Allow students to take P/F grading options for limited number (a reasonable number could be \~5) of courses which are not core courses closely related to their major
2. For courses in the past semester before the amendment, provide students (including those who have graduated or withdrawn from the university) with an one-off retroactive P/F option within the quota mentioned above.

c) For future semesters, students shall choose the grading option before a specific deadline within the semester

**Key Pros**

1. The proposal only raises the overall GPA moderately and prevent excessive inflation of GPA that may possibly jeopardise the academic reputation of the university.
2. The amended system allows the commutative GPA of students’ to converge to their major GPA, being more capable of reflecting their performance in their major.
3. Such amendment may subject to less parties of concern, and it in general complies with the good of all stakeholders of the university.
4. The limited quota guarantees that the motivation for **interdisciplinary studies and general education remains strong**

**Key Rationale:**

1. The amendment is in line with the practice with renown institutions around the globe. Taking as an example UC Berkeley, an academic powerhouse in the States, let alone its already being famous for GPA DEFLATION in North America, it allows students to take PNP grading option in non-technical courses for no more than 1/3 of credits (whose restriction is far looser than our proposal aforementioned, taking into consideration possible concern from Shatin).
2. Students are required to take school packages which may not be relevant to their major (e.g. a CS student taking Physics, Chemistry and Bio) in their first year, which can be a good practice per se to allow students to explore their true passion. However, students may suffer from the negative impacts on their GPA by these subjects, which may really not be relevant. The purposed solution can tackle such problem to a great extent.
3. Amid the global trend of GPA inflation, our GPA system in CUHK-SZ has students GREATLY UNDERRATED, especially when compared with the counterparts in China and the States. The problem does not only lie in the average level of GPA, but the unreasonable distribution. Long story short, the problem is twofold: unreasonable grade distribution intra- and inter- course. In terms of intra-course grade distribution, our range above A- level is far below our counterparts in China and the States, including those with comparable average GPA as ours. And the unreasonable distribution among courses are mentioned in point 2 above. The problem has SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES: students face increasing difficulties and uncertainty in application to grad school and their future careers DISPROPORTIONAL with their true abilities. It also causes enormous amount of anxiety.

#### Key Proposal II - Reform Letter Grade-Grade Point Correlation

a) Update the correlation between letter grade and grade point to A = 4.0, A- = 4.0, B+ = 3.6, B = 3.3, B- = 3.0, C+ = 2.6, C = 2.3, C- = 2.0, D+ = 1.6, D = 1.3, F = 0.0.

b) For courses in the past semester before the amendment, one-off updating students’ term cGPA, total cGPA, and total mGPA according to student’s past course grades and new correlation. This should apply to all students including those who have graduated or withdrawn from the university.
